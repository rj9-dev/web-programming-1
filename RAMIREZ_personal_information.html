        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>&nbsp Hello, I'm Ryan Jay Ramirez. You can call me RJ if you're okay with that. I am at the age where I enjoy my youth, at least I thought. Living in the mountain area of Iriga City where the electricity was somewhat like a christmas light even though it's not really the month of December. I'm currently studying Computer Science program in one of the university here at my province. Recently I'm near at embracing insanity due to the activities and schoolworks to be done in a short due. Though it's entirely my fault why things are like that.</p>
