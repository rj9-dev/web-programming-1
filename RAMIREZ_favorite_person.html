            &nbsp&nbsp I call him Robo-.. Opps, it's 'Mark'. One of my favorite 'person'(?). He is an intellectual being, and he's also a very hardworking 'human'(?). Imagine, he did created one of the most popular social media app called 'Fishbook'. Well, aside from those stuff, Mark became helpful at all times to his friends, including me! He provided an innovative way to help me contact my loved ones and message my close friends in an instant. So, I'm being grateful for his doings. A very gentleman 'person'(?)
